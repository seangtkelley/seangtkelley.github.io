Hello, I am a second year student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. In addition, I hope to complete a minor in Spanish.

I am very passionate about the worlds of machine learning and data science and the impact they can have on my community and the world as a whole. 

I hope to use this blog to log my personal findings. Whether those findings be my preferred linux setup or data analyses, I want it to be here for my reference and for the reference of others.

Everything I post will be under [MIT License](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) unless otherwise specified so feel free to use as you wish.
