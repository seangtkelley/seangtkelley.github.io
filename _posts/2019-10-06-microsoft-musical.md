I just wanted to share just a small glimpse into my internship at Microsoft this summer. Although I already posted [this to my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6586367297240260608/), I wanted it to be here as well. Catch my name in the credits for Guitar! ðŸŽ¸ 

Microsoft the Musical exemplifies why I truly enjoyed going into work each day. I had the unique privilege of collaborating with fantastically smart, creative, and passionate people each day.

A huge shout out to all the interns and full-timers that made this possible and who worked crazy hours putting this together. Also, a huge thanks to my manager [Cherie Quek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheriequek/) and mentor [Cody Plante](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codyrplante/) for making every day of my internship a pleasure and cultivating a challenging problem for me to tackle.
